here is a reminder of all the recipes and their respective recipeIds in parentheses:
Chicken Alfredo Pasta (1), Spiced Beef Tacos (2), Garlic Shrimp Stir-fry (3), Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream (4), Classic Beef Stew (5), Honey Garlic Salmon (6), Mushroom and Spinach Pasta (7), Apple Cinnamon Pancakes (8), Lemon Garlic Roasted Chicken (9), Homemade Margherita Pizza (10), Spicy Tofu Stir-Fry (11), Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies (12), Banana Nut Pancakes (13), Avocado Shrimp Salad (14), Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup (15), Classic Apple Pie (16), Spaghetti Carbonara (17), Grilled Salmon with Lemon and Dill (18), Pork Stir-Fry with Broccoli and Bell Peppers (19), Chocolate Chip Banana Bread (20), Mushroom Risotto (21), Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins (22), Thai Shrimp Curry (23), Homemade Blueberry Pie (24), Greek Salad (25), Pesto Chicken Pasta (26), Vegetarian Bean Chili (27), Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal (28)

Now i want you to output RecipeIngredients in a json format. These are the entities that link a recipe to an ingredient. for each recipe, create an entry for each ingredient the recipe calls for, where each recipeingredient looks like:
{
	"RecipeIngredientId": "{incremented integer here}",
	"RecipeId": "{RecipeId goes here}",
	"IngredientId": "{IngredientId goes here}",
	"Name": "{use the Name of the ingredient here}",
	"Description": "{the amount called for of the ingredient}",
	"Details": "{anything more specific about the ingredient that should be considered. most of the recipeingredients should have something here}",
	"Order": "{the order of the recipeingredient in a list}",
	"Optional": "false"
}

do this for as many recipes as you can fit in your character limit, making sure to include every recipeIngredient for a given recipe, in the order of their RecipeIds, then note which recipe was the last one you were able to fit. again do not use indents or newlines and omit the opening and closing square brackets, and include a comma after the final closing curly brace you generate

Now i want you to output RecipeSteps in a json format. These are the entities that link a recipe to a cooking step in making the recipe. for each recipe, create an entry for each step the recipe calls for, where each recipestep looks like:
{
	"RecipeStepId": "{incremented integer here}",
	"RecipeId": "{RecipeId goes here}",
	"Name": "",
	"Description": "{a description of the step}",
	"Details": "{anything more specific about the step that should be considered e.g. alternative methods, how long the step should take etc. most of the recipeingredients should have something here}",
	"Order": "{the order of the recipestep in a list}",
	"Optional": "false"
}

now i want you to consider all 28 recipes and come up with a set of category tags such that each recipe has at least one tag (preferably 2, maximum 5). Keep the total number of tags to a low enough number that tags are shared by the recipes.

give me the tags in json format that looks like this:
[
{
	"TagId":"{incrementing integer id}",
	"Name":"{name of the tag}"
}
]

[
{"TagId":"1","Name":"Poultry"},
{"TagId":"2","Name":"Beef"},
{"TagId":"3","Name":"Seafood"},
{"TagId":"4","Name":"Vegetarian"},
{"TagId":"5","Name":"Pasta"},
{"TagId":"6","Name":"Soup"},
{"TagId":"7","Name":"Salad"},
{"TagId":"8","Name":"Dessert"},
{"TagId":"9","Name":"Bread"},
{"TagId":"10","Name":"Pork"},
{"TagId":"11","Name":"Italian"},
{"TagId":"12","Name":"Mexican"},
{"TagId":"13","Name":"Asian"},
{"TagId":"14","Name":"American"},
{"TagId":"15","Name":"Breakfast"},
{"TagId":"16","Name":"Snack"},
{"TagId":"17","Name":"Main Course"},
{"TagId":"18","Name":"Side Dish"},
{"TagId":"19","Name":"Healthy"},
{"TagId":"20","Name":"Comfort Food"}
]

now generate the json defining RecipeTags, which link a recipe to a tag that applies to it. the json should look like:
[
{
	"RecipeId":"{RecipeId of the recipe this recipetag applies to}",
	"TagId":"{TagId of the tag we are applying}"
}
]
