Now i want you to output RecipeIngredients in a json format. These are the entities that link a recipe to an ingredient. for each recipe, create an entry for each ingredient the recipe calls for, where each recipeingredient looks like:

	"Details": "{anything more specific about the ingredient that should be considered. most of the recipeingredients should have something here}",
